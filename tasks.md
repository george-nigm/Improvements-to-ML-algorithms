# Project objective

Creating a system of imputation and anomaly detection to improve the performance of the ML model (+casuality inference?)

# Tasks

1.  Creating a pull of imputing methods
2.  Add imputing methods in project
3.  Performing expirements with imputing on 2 datasets
4.  10/30/50% data dropping
    1.  Creating a pull of datasets

    2.  5 standart datasets
6.  Perform anomalie detection (4 methods) on
    1. 2 initial datasets
